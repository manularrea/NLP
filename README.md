# NLP - Natural Language Processing

This repository contains implementations and practical examples of techniques and algorithms used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our goal is to provide a collection of tools and resources that facilitate the understanding and application of NLP methods in real-world projects.

## Repository Contents

- **Text Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing textual data.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Implementations for evaluating and classifying sentiment in texts.
- **Language Models:** Examples of using language models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformers (BERT, GPT).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Tools and examples for identifying and classifying named entities in texts.
- **Text Classification:** Algorithms for categorizing documents into predefined categories.
- **Text Generation:** Examples of automatic text generation using advanced language models.
